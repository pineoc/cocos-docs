# Create a list of dynamically generated content

We can build and edit static UI interfaces with **Scene** panel easily, but in real world game project it's not enough. We'll need dynamically generated UI elements with data, such as character selection, inventory and level selection.


## Prepare data

Let's take an inventory interface as example, we need following data structure to generate an item dynamically:

- Item id
- Icon id, we can put up a icon id to spriteFrame reference dictionary or array
- Item name
- Item price
- ...

We will introduce how to define a data class and generate those data in **Properties** panel. If you're not familiar with Cocos Creator's component system, please start with [Workflow of script development](../scripting/index.md) chapter.


### Custom data class

For most game project, you can get inventory data from game server. For the simplicity let's define a data class for data structure and input. Let's add a new script `ItemList.js` and add the following properties:

```js
var Item = cc.Class({
    name: 'Item',
    properties: {
        id: 0,
        itemName: '',
        itemPrice: 0,
        iconSF: cc.SpriteFrame
    }
});

cc.Class({
    extends: cc.Component,
    properties: {
        items: {
            default: [],
            type: Item
        }
    },
});
```

We defined an `Item` class at the top of the script for storing and easily updating data needed by item. Please notice this class does not extends `cc.Component`, so it can be defined as a property type for any component. You can learn more details about data class here [Declare class](../scripting/class.md).

After the `Item` class definition, we defined a component class. Each script file can only contains one component definition and the component name will be the same as the file name. So the component we define is `ItemList`. In this component we have a list property which type is `Item`. This way we can populate the list with data input in **Properties** panel.

Now let's create an empty node and add `ItemList` component. We can find `Items` property in **Properties** panel. To populate data, let's give the list a length. Type `3` in the field and you can input data like these:

![item list](list-with-data/itemlist.png)

We have our data ready for now, you can also type in more data entries as you wish. If you're making a game with lots of data, please consider using more specialized data source like Excel and database. It's easy to convert such data sources to JSON for the engine.


## Make the view for data: Prefab as template

Let's now move on to the 'view' to visualize data, we can use [Prefab](../asset-workflow/prefab.md) to do this job. Let's create a prefab that looks like this:

![item template](list-with-data/item-template.png)

The children `icon`, `name`, `price` will be used to display icon, item name and price from data.

### Data binding

You can freely customize the prefab as you need, the picture above only shows an example. Now we need a component script to bind the data to the components that show them. Create a new script `ItemTemplate.js` and add it to the prefab root node. The script contains:

```js
cc.Class({
    extends: cc.Component,
    properties: {
        id: 0,
        icon: cc.Sprite,
        itemName: cc.Label,
        itemPrice: cc.Label
    }
});
```

Let's drag all those nodes onto the property fields of `ItemTemplate` component.

![item binding](list-with-data/item-binding.png)

**Notice** we will assign value for `id` property through script, no data binding needed.

### Update template display with script

Let's modify `ItemTemplate.js` script to add function to update the render components with input data. Let's add the following to the end of script (inside class definition):

```js
    properties: {
    ...
    },
    // data: {id,iconSF,itemName,itemPrice}
    init: function (data) {
        this.id = data.id;
        this.icon.spriteFrame = data.iconSF;
        this.itemName.string = data.itemName;
        this.itemPrice.string = data.itemPrice;
    }
```

`init` method takes a data object and use the data to update each render component on bound nodes. Now we can save `Item` node as a Prefab asset and use it as the template of our item entries.

## Instantiate template with data

Let's go back to `ItemList.js` script and add reference to our Prefab and them instantiate it with data.

```js
    properties: {
        //...
        itemPrefab: cc.Prefab
    },

    onLoad () {
        for (var i = 0; i < this.items.length; ++i) {
            var item = cc.instantiate(this.itemPrefab);
            var data = this.items[i];
            this.node.addChild(item);
            item.getComponent('ItemTemplate').init({
                id: data.id,
                itemName: data.itemName,
                itemPrice: data.itemPrice,
                iconSF: data.iconSF
            });
        }
    }
```

In `onLoad` method we go through each data entry of `items` list, instantiate `itemPrefab` for each data entry and call `init` method of `ItemList` component to update its display.

We can also add a **Layout** component to node that holds `ItemList`, and set the properties like these:

- `Type`: `HORIZONTAL`
- `Resize Mode`: `CONTAINER`

Don't forget to drag and drag `item` Prefab to `itemPrefab` property field of `ItemList` component. You can also add a **Sprite** component to the node as the background.

We have completed all the work. Now `itemList` node should look like this:

![itemlist complete](list-with-data/itemlist-complete.png)

## Preview

Running preview of the scene will get the result like this (the acutal look depends on how your template was setup and your data):

![result](list-with-data/result.png)

The **Layout** component added in previous step is not necessary. We can use it to help putting multiple items in a container in order but you can also use your own logic to do that. You can also add a **ScrollView** setup to display large amount of content in a limited space. For details of those layout method please read [Auto Layout Container](auto-layout.md) and [ScrollView Component](ui-components.md#scrollview).
