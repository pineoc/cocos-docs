Click the `add component` at the bottom of **Properties** and select `Animation` from `add other components` in order to add the **Animation** component to the node.


## Animation attribute

| Attribute |   Function explanation
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Default Clip | Default animation editing. If you set the value for this as one and **Play On Load** as true, then the animation will play the contents of **Default Clip** automatically after loading.
| Clips | Default list type is null. If you add an **AnimationClip** in here, then it will be mirrored in the **animation editor**; users can edit the contents of **Clips** in the **animation editor**
| Play On Load | Boolean type. Chooses whether to play the content of the **Default Clip** automatically after the animation loads.

## Detailed description

If we need to have many nodes contained in one animation, then normally we will create a new node as the **root node** of the animation and add the **Animation ** component to this **root node**. The other child nodes of the root node will then automatically enter this animation.

If the following node tree is added:

Then the hierarchy in the animation editor will show:
